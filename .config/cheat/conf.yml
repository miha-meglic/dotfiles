cheatpaths:
  # Paths that come earlier are considered to be the most "global", and will
  # thus be overridden by more local cheatsheets. That being the case, you
  # should probably list community cheatsheets first.
  #
  # Community cheatsheets must be installed separately, though you may have
  # downloaded them automatically when installing 'cheat'. If not, you may
  # download them here: https://github.com/cheat/cheatsheets

  # While it requires no configuration here, it's also worth noting that
  # 'cheat' will automatically append directories named '.cheat' within the
  # current working directory to the 'cheatpath'. This can be very useful if
  # you'd like to closely associate cheatsheets with, for example, a directory
  # containing source code.
